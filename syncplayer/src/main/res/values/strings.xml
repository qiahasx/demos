        Whether to use libsndfile/libsamplerate for audio resampling during playback.\n
        This is a relatively lightweight, high-performance, high-quality C library.\n
        JNI invocation and complex algorithms may introduce higher performance overhead.\n
        If disabled, a linear interpolation resampling algorithm written in Kotlin will be used.\n
        The Kotlin implementation has better performance but produces mediocre quality.\n\n
        Note: libsamplerate may occasionally introduce noise (cause unknown).

    AudioSyncPlayer is an audio synchronization player.\n
    It can play multiple audio files and synchronize their playback progress.\n
    It also allows adjusting the volume of each audio track.\n
    It supports playing audio files with different channel counts or sample rates, and will automatically resample to the highest values by default.\n
